Leveraging web2 Social with Anonymous Authentication and Verification

## Project Description
Users can effortlessly add their videos, benefitting from off-chain verification powered by the UMA protocol which let users assert that they own a certain Video Link. There is a time period when anyone can challenge these assertions and prevent this.But here's the twist - to watch these videos, users must meet specific criteria, whether they're on-chain or off-chain. We make it possible through our zkPass TransGate

We're solving critical issues such as private web2 streaming, all based on On-chain or Off-chain data. No more false comments on videos, as only experienced individuals are allowed to view and comment.

## How it's Made
AnonYSurf leverages the latest technology like Next.js for a dynamic frontend, Moralis-Web3UiKit for a smooth user experience, and Js for Chrome extension. This, combined with UMA protocol and zkPass, ensures a seamless and secure experience for all without revealing and sharing any private data of user.
